            <ul>
                <li>Always double-check the website URL. Phishing sites often look similar to legitimate ones, but may have slight changes in the address (e.g., adding extra characters).</li>
                <li>Never share personal information on unfamiliar sites.</li>
                <li>Use strong and unique passwords for every account, and enable two-factor authentication when possible.</li>
                <li>If you think this page was blocked in error, contact your IT department or support team for verification.</li>
